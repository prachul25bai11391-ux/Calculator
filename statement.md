# Problem Statement: Scientific Calculator Application

## Aim
To design and develop a Scientific Calculator application using Python's Tkinter library that facilitates both basic arithmetic and complex scientific mathematical operations.

## Objectives
1.  To implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library.
2.  To utilize the Python `math` module for computing scientific functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponents, etc.).
3.  To create a responsive layout that switches between standard and scientific modes.

## Software Requirements
* **Operating System:** Windows / Linux / MacOS
* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **IDE/Editor:** VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE

## Description
The calculator serves as a comprehensive tool for students and professionals. It solves the problem of needing separate tools for basic and advanced calculations. The application features a clear display, a numeric keypad, and a dedicated section for scientific functions, all managed within a single window frame using Python's grid geometry manager.
